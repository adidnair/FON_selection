# Why Rust?

-   Rust is a modern programming language that provides the performance and control of low-level languages like C with the safety and ease of use of high-level languages like Python.
-   Rust&rsquo;s borrow checker provides memory safety checks at compile time resulting in safe code that does not need to be debugged frequently.
-   Building the project in a language like Rust instead of a simulation software like MATLAB will help in scaling the project in any direction; and also will help in building an intuition of how the data is propogated through the network.
